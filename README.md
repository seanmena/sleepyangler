# Sleepy Angler, A fly fish Company

Live Link (for now)

# Description
I built this website for my brother who is a fly fish guide. I used React.js, CSS, and Firebase. It has an auth system to verify the admin user. The Admin user may create/delete blog posts, upload/delete photos to a gallery, and manage contact form submissions. There are many protected routes that appear only if you are a specified user. Regular users may browse the gallery and blog. As well as submit a contact form to get booking details. 

# Design in Figma
I created the ui in Figma, I used Adobe Photoshop to manipulate assets to be compatabile with the website. Here's some photos of different designs I made:
